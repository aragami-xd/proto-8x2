Yeah so this pic said it all, but I swear it's a board this time and not just a pcb

### FRL

It's an FRL cuz cbf dealing with aek f row. This is like **rev 5** of the design now

### Progress
- case: pretty much done at this point
- solenoid: solenoid compartment done, solenoid driver and power delivery circuitry still sus af, db compartment kinda done
- backplate: done
- alps pcb: routing and schematic done, just need to put in the reference for the diodes and any bit of clean up left
- alps plate: probably done
- SI pcb: routing and schematic done, just need to put in the reference for the diodes and any bit of clean up left
- SI plate: not started yet, probably easy (just need to figure out stabs mount)

TODO:
- find amber alps
- find sussy aek for the caps
- make sure stuff work
- buy solenoids
- cry looking at wallet
