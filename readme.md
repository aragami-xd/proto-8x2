Yeah so this pic said it all, but I swear it's a board this time and not just a pcb

### Anyways it's an AEK

<br>

**FRL** (current): probably gonna cost like 350usd most for the top, haven't quoted the bottom or figure out what to do with it yet

*pic from rev 4 render with cf alps plate (using cherry stabs for those dcs caps)*

FRL cuz i cbf dealing with aek and normal caps f row height differences. 4 deg typing angle

**Southpaw** (on hold): rip wallet

### Progress

Southpaw: on hold

FRL:
- case: 
  - got the plate, mounting method, top case quite sorted out. still need to drill holes in the top case for the mounting points or other refinement if needed
  - bottom case: might need to be reworked somewhat. case too thin might lead to severe warping, and i might carve out more room for the case to fit 2 solenoids, beeper and weight
- pcb:
  - rp2040 routing is quite decent atm, still need the solenoid and beeper circuit on it
- plate:
  - hard and soft top mount (mount at the extended tabs)

TODO:
- solenoid
- beeper
- (maybe) internal weight
- (maybe) daughterboard
- find amber alps

Also credit to clickpig for naming this board "**halfpipe**". Damn the original drawing in paint was bad
