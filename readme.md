### Progress

Southpaw: on hold

FRL:
- case: pretty much done at this point
- pcb: might just rip off harky's pcb
- plate: too lazy to finish

TODO:
- solenoid: compartment is done, need pcb for it
- beeper
- ~~(maybe) internal weight~~: 2 internal weights at the solenoid compartments
- ~~(maybe) daughterboard~~: done
- find amber alps
